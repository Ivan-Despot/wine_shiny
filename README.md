# WineEnthusiast Shiny App

This project was completed as part of the milestone project for DSCI 532 - Data Visualization 2 in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

The Shiny app allows a user to explore the [WineEnthusiast](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) dataset, and identify the best wine for any occasion. You may filter the data by country, variety, and price.
